# LingmoNix Starter
LingmoNix "Yaksha" Starter
## Installation
run the command:
```bash
curl https://lingmoos-testing.github.io/LingmoNix-Starter/ > install.sh && sudo bash install.sh
```
## Develop
LingmoNix mirrored the repository at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/arkimium_76/LingmoNix-Starter) (PS. May be deprecated because there is no way to pull the latest source code from GitHub) and [Gitee](https://gitee.com/arkimium_76/LingmoNix-Starter). (Recommanded for Chinese Developers, will be synced every Saturday)
## TODO List
- [ ] the **PORTION** of the Softwares from _Lingmo Software_.
